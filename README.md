# Introduction to Computer Vision

This is the repository where I will be posting the solutions that I come up with
for the Georgia Tech [CS 6476](https://www.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-computer-vision--ud810) course.

## About this Course

This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals
of image formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching,
multiview geometry including stereo, motion estimation and tracking, and classification.
Weâ€™ll develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models
in images, depth recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization,
automated alignment (e.g. panoramas), tracking, and action recognition.
We focus less on the machine learning aspect of CV as that is really
classification theory best learned in an ML course.

The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the
methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and
practice in the problem sets. All algorithms work perfectly in the slides.
But remember what **Yogi Berra** said: *In theory there is no difference between theory and practice*.
